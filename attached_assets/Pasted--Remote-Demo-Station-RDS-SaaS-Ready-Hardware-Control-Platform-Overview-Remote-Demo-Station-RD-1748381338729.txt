üîß Remote Demo Station (RDS) ‚Äì SaaS-Ready Hardware Control Platform
Overview
Remote Demo Station (RDS) is a real-time web-based platform that allows users to interact with physical hardware ‚Äî such as precision actuators, motors, or mechatronic devices ‚Äî from anywhere, directly via a browser. Originally designed for internal demonstrations, RDS is now a fully productized, multi-tenant SaaS solution, enabling companies to showcase, test, and operate their devices remotely through an intuitive control interface and a low-latency WebRTC video feed, similar to how Bambu Lab streams live prints from its 3D printers.

üß± What Is a Demo Station?
Each demo station is a compact, networked hardware module built for remote access and visibility. It includes:

A microcontroller or motion controller (e.g., USB/RS485/ETH interface)

One or more precision actuators or devices under test

A Raspberry Pi client running the control agent

A camera module (e.g., Pi Camera v3) for real-time visual feedback

Optional: limit switches, sensors, lighting, or add-on peripherals

Configurable safety boundaries (software-defined travel limits)

Power and network interface (LAN or Wi-Fi)

Optional: enclosure, mounting, or ruggedization for industrial or tradeshow use

Each demo station runs a lightweight Python client that communicates with the central SaaS backend using WebSocket + HTTPS, handles automatic reconnects, and streams telemetry and video in real time.

üí° Core Features (SaaS-Optimized)
Multi-Tenant Architecture
Isolated Organizations: Each customer (tenant) manages its own users, demo stations, and logs

Role-Based Access: Admin, Operator, Viewer permissions within each tenant

Super Admin Panel: Full visibility and override control across tenants for system operators

Custom Branding: Logos, color themes, and vanity domains per tenant

Real-Time Hardware Control
Precise movement control: position, speed (e.g. 1‚Äì500 mm/s), acceleration

Control primitives: stepping, scanning, homing, range limits

WebSocket-based live command stream to the Pi station

Feedback every 0.1 seconds from device position, with timestamped logs

Safety: software range limits, session timeout, emergency stop

Ultra-Low Latency Video via WebRTC
H.264 encoded video streamed via WebRTC using Raspberry Pi‚Äôs hardware encoder

Fully browser-compatible (<video> element with autoplay support)

STUN/TURN traversal to ensure it works behind firewalls, hotel Wi-Fi, and corporate NAT

Optional SFU integration (Janus, mediasoup) for public/live multi-user demos

This architecture mirrors proven consumer-grade systems like Bambu Lab, ensuring professional performance with industrial flexibility.

üåê Infrastructure & Deployment
Replit-Compatible: Runs in Replit with SQLite or external Postgres

Database Advice: ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Neon DB ‚Äî it‚Äôs costly for high-write applications like streaming telemetry. Use Supabase, Railway, or self-hosted PostgreSQL.

Dockerized Setup: Containers for backend, frontend, and WebRTC signaling services

Client OTA-Ready: Update Raspberry Pi software remotely via Git pull or SSH

TURN Server Included: Coturn for network traversal in SaaS deployments

On-Premise Option: Deploy entire stack locally for sensitive enterprise/lab use
